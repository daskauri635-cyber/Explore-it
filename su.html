    </div>
Albert Einstein was a revolutionary physicist whose theories reshaped our understanding of the universe. Born in 1879 in Ulm, Germany, he developed the theory of relativity, most famously encapsulated in the equation *E = mcÂ²*, which revealed the relationship between energy and mass. His work laid the foundation for modern physics and influenced everything from quantum mechanics to cosmology. Einstein was also a passionate advocate for peace, civil rights, and humanitarian causes. After fleeing Nazi Germany, he settled in the United States, where he continued his scientific work and social activism. His legacy endures as a symbol of intellectual brilliance and moral courage.
