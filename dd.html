      <h3>Jane Goodall</h3>
    </div>
Jane Goodall is a pioneering British primatologist, ethologist, and environmentalist renowned for her groundbreaking work with chimpanzees. Born in 1934, she traveled to Tanzania in 1960, where she began an extraordinary study of wild chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park. Her observations—such as chimpanzees using tools and displaying complex emotions—revolutionized our understanding of primates and challenged long-held beliefs about the divide between humans and animals. Beyond her scientific contributions, Goodall has become a global advocate for conservation and animal welfare, founding the Jane Goodall Institute and the Roots & Shoots youth program. Her lifelong dedication continues to inspire generations to protect the natural world.
