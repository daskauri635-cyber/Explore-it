      <h3>Marie Curie</h3>
    </div>
Marie Curie was a pioneering physicist and chemist whose groundbreaking research on radioactivity transformed science and medicine. Born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1867, she moved to Paris to study at the Sorbonne, where she became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize—and remains the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields: Physics (1903) and Chemistry (1911). Alongside her husband Pierre Curie, she discovered the elements polonium and radium, and developed techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes. Her work laid the foundation for modern cancer treatments and nuclear science. Curie’s legacy endures as a symbol of scientific brilliance, perseverance, and trailblazing achievement for women in STEM.
