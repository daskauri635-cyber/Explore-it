      <h3>Rosa Parks</h3>
    </div>
Rosa Parks was a pivotal figure in the American civil rights movement, best known for her courageous act of defiance in 1955 when she refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Her quiet strength sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a landmark event that propelled Martin Luther King Jr. into national prominence and helped dismantle institutionalized racial segregation. Born in 1913, Parks was deeply involved in civil rights activism long before her famous protest, working with the NAACP and advocating for justice throughout her life. She remains a symbol of dignity, resistance, and the power of one individual to ignite change.
