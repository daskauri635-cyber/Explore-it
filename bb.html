Nelson Mandela was a towering figure in the global fight against apartheid and a symbol of resilience, justice, and reconciliation. Born in 1918 in the village of Mvezo, South Africa, Mandela became a lawyer and a leading voice in the African National Congress, opposing the institutionalized racial segregation of apartheid. After spending 27 years in prison for his activism, he emerged as a unifying leader and was elected South Africa’s first Black president in 1994. Mandela’s presidency focused on healing a divided nation through forgiveness and inclusivity. His legacy continues to inspire movements for equality and human rights around the world
