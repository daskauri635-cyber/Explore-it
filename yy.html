      <h3>Cesar Chavez</h3>
    </div>
Cesar Chavez was a prominent American labor leader and civil rights activist who dedicated his life to improving conditions for farmworkers. Born in 1927 in Yuma, Arizona, he co-founded the United Farm Workers (UFW) union and led nonviolent protests, strikes, and boycotts to demand fair wages, safer working conditions, and dignity for agricultural laborers—many of whom were Latino and marginalized. Inspired by figures like Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., Chavez emphasized peaceful resistance and community empowerment. His legacy lives on as a symbol of grassroots activism and the enduring fight for social justice and workers’ rights in the United States.
