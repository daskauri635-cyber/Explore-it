      <h3>Anne Frank</h3>
    </div>
Anne Frank was a young Jewish diarist whose writings became one of the most powerful and personal accounts of the Holocaust. Born on June 12, 1929, in Frankfurt, Germany, she and her family fled to Amsterdam to escape Nazi persecution. In 1942, they went into hiding in a secret annex behind her father's business. During this time, Anne kept a diary, documenting her thoughts, fears, and hopes with remarkable insight and maturity.

Her family was discovered in 1944 and deported to concentration camps. Anne died in early 1945 at Bergen-Belsen at the age of 15. After the war, her father Otto Frank—the only surviving member of the family—published her diary, *The Diary of a Young Girl*, which has since been translated into over 70 languages and remains a poignant symbol of resilience and the human spirit.

Anne Frank’s legacy continues to educate and inspire people around the world about the dangers of hatred, discrimination, and the importance of human rights.
