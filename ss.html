    </div>
Martin Luther King Jr. was a transformative leader in the American civil rights movement, renowned for his unwavering commitment to nonviolent protest and racial equality. Born in 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia, King rose to prominence during the Montgomery Bus Boycott and later led pivotal campaigns across the U.S. to challenge segregation and injustice. His powerful speeches, especially the iconic “I Have a Dream” address, galvanized a generation and helped usher in landmark legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, King’s legacy endures as a symbol of moral courage, justice, and the enduring fight for human dignity.
