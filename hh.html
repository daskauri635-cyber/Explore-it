Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani education activist and the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Born in 1997 in Mingora, Pakistan, she became a global symbol of courage after surviving an assassination attempt by the Taliban in 2012 for advocating girlsâ€™ education. Her fearless activism began at a young age, blogging for the BBC about life under Taliban rule and speaking out against the ban on girls attending school. Malala co-founded the Malala Fund to champion education for girls worldwide and continues to be a powerful voice for equality, human rights, and peace. Her story is a testament to resilience and the transformative power of education.
