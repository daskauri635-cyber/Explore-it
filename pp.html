      <h3>Harriet Tubman</h3>
    </div>
Harriet Tubman was an extraordinary American abolitionist and humanitarian who risked her life to lead enslaved people to freedom. Born into slavery in Maryland around 1822, she escaped in 1849 and became a conductor on the Underground Railroad, guiding dozens of others to liberty through a secret network of safe houses. Known as “Moses” for her fearless leadership, Tubman also served as a spy, nurse, and scout for the Union Army during the Civil War. Her legacy as a symbol of courage, resilience, and justice continues to inspire generations fighting for freedom and equality.
